# DAX IdentityServer

**DAX IdentityServer** is a sandbox implementation of [Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/) designed for exploring and managing OAuth2 / OpenID Connect clients within a distributed architecture setup.

This repository is part of the **DAX (Distributed Architecture eXamples)** project and serves as the authentication and authorization core in the sandbox ecosystem.

---

## Purpose

This project makes it easy to:

- Experiment with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect flows
- Register and manage identity clients in a simple, editable way
- Prototype login, token issuance, and validation for APIs and frontends
- Understand the role of an Identity Provider in microservices

---

## Key Features

- Sandbox-friendly setup using Duende IdentityServer
- In-memory or JSON-based client/resource configuration
- Optional custom user store and login logic
- Ideal for testing BFF, SPA, and API auth scenarios
- Fast local development with `dotnet run`

---

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mengio001/DaxIdentityServer.git
cd DaxIdentityServer
dotnet run
```

Once running, the IdentityServer UI will be available at:

```
https://localhost:44300
```

Use this as your authority URL for other DAX components (e.g., BFFs, APIs, SPAs).
